                <p>Broken people get recycled</br>
                    And I hope that I will...</br>
                    Sometimes we're thrown off our pathways</br>
                    What I thought was my way home</br>
                    Wasn't the place I know</p>
                <p>No, I'm not afraid of changing</br>
                   I'm certain nothing's certain</br>
                   What we own becomes our prison</br>
                   My possessions will be gone</br>
                   Back to where they came from</p>
                <p>Blame, no-one is to blame</br>
                    As natural as the rain that falls</br>
                    Here comes the flood again</p>
                <p>See the rock that you hold onto,</br>
                    Is it gonna save you?</br>
                    When the earth begins to crumble?</br>
                    Why'd you feel you have to hold on?</br>
                    Imagine if you let go!</p>
                <p>Blame, no one is to blame</br>
                    As natural as the rain that falls</br>
                    Here comes the Flood again</p>
                <p>Wash away the weight that pulls you down</br>
                    Ride the waves that free you from your doubts</p>
                <p>Don't trust your eyes</br>
                    It's easy to believe them </br>
                    Know with your heart</br>
                    That you can leave your prison</br>
                    Don't trust your mind</br>
                    It's not always listening</br>
                    Turn on the lights </br>
                    And feel the ancient rhythm</br>
                    Don't trust your eyes</br>
                    It's easy to believe them</br>
                    Know in your heart</br>
                    That you can leave your prison</p>
                <p>Blame, no-one is to blame,</br>
                    As natural as the rain that falls</br>
                    Here comes the Flood again</p>
